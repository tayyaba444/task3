 Excited to share my latest project on Predicting Customer Churn! 🚀

I recently developed a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns and demographics. Here’s a quick overview of the project:

Project Highlights:
🔍 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers
Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Scaled numerical features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn distribution and feature correlations
Identified key features impacting churn
🔧 Feature Engineering:

Created new features to enhance model performance
🤖 Model Selection and Training:

Implemented and fine-tuned a Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV
Achieved an accuracy of X.XX% on the test set
🛠️ Model Evaluation:

Generated detailed classification reports and confusion matrices
Ensured the model is robust and reliable
🌐 Deployment:

Saved the trained model using Joblib for real-world applications
Ready to predict churn for new customer data
